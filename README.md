# Rift Vibe Solver

This is a tool for visualizing the optimal Vibe activations for a chart in Rift of the Necrodancer

## To Use

To use the Visualizer, run the program and open a .bin file generated by [RiftEventCapture](https://github.com/DominicAglialoro/RiftEventCapture). Upon opening a file, the Visualizer will display the following:

* Every instant in which you hit an enemy, indicated by a white dot, positioned vertically based on the number of points gained by that hit (multiple simultaneous hits are considered a single hit worth the sum of each hit)
* Every instant in which you gain Vibe, indicated by a vertical yellow line
* The amount of bonus points you'll gain by activating Vibe at any point in time, indicated by a pair of bar graphs (green for single Vibe activations, blue for double Vibe activations)
* The set of optimal Vibe activations, indicated by gold lines on top of the aforementioned bar graphs
* The total amount of bonus points you'll gain by performing all optimal Vibe activations

You can navigate the chart by using the mouse wheel to scroll, and holding shift and scrolling to zoom in or out

Click on the graph to visualize a Vibe activation starting at that particular point in time. Clicking on the lower half of the graph will display a single Vibe activation, while clicking on the upper half of the graph will display a double vibe activation
